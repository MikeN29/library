Outcomes:

-User can fill out a form inputting book details, this uses a object constructor and is stored in the mylibrary array.

-User can click display books to view books.

-Books can be removed from the array and display by using .splice and refreshing the displayBooks function.

-I have created a prototype which changes the Books isRead property to the opposite. This means the book can be marked read.
